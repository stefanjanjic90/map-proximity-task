## Checklist

- Find a solution for grouping nearby breweries markers together, when zooming out. (2 points)
- If the user clicks on the group then there we generate a list of all items from the selected group using AngularJS. (2 points)
- If the user selects an item from the list then we zoom into the brewery marker. (2 points)
- Lastly if we click on the marker then we show a popup with the name of the brewery. (2 points)
- As a bonus the breweries should have a nice beer icon (2 points)
